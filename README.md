# Basic RESTful API using FastAPI
This project demonstrates a basic RESTful API built using FastAPI. The API supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a simple in-memory data store.

Features
- GET /posts: Retrieve all posts
- POST /posts: Create a new post
- GET /posts/{id}: Retrieve a post by ID
- PUT /posts/{id}: Update a post by ID
- DELETE /posts/{id}: Delete a post by ID
- GET /posts/latest: Retrieve the latest post

**Technologies Used**
- FastAPI: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
- Pydantic: Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
- Python: The main programming language used.
